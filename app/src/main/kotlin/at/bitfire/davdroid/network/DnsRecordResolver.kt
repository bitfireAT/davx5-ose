           Priority
                The priority of this target host.  A client MUST attempt to
                contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority it can
                reach; target hosts with the same priority SHOULD be tried in an
                order defined by the weight field. [...]
           Weight
                A server selection mechanism.  The weight field specifies a
                relative weight for entries with the same priority. [...]
                To select a target to be contacted next, arrange all SRV RRs
                (that have not been ordered yet) in any order, except that all
                those with weight 0 are placed at the beginning of the list.
                Compute the sum of the weights of those RRs, and with each RR
                associate the running sum in the selected order. Then choose a
                uniform random number between 0 and the sum computed
                (inclusive), and select the RR whose running sum value is the
                first in the selected order which is greater than or equal to
                the random number selected. The target host specified in the
                selected SRV RR is the next one to be contacted by the client.
