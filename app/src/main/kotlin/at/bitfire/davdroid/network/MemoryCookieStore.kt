        11.  If the cookie store contains a cookie with the same name,
        domain, and path as the newly created cookie:

            1.  Let old-cookie be the existing cookie with the same name,
            domain, and path as the newly created cookie.  (Notice that
            this algorithm maintains the invariant that there is at most
            one such cookie.)

            2.  If the newly created cookie was received from a "non-HTTP"
            API and the old-cookie's http-only-flag is set, abort these
            steps and ignore the newly created cookie entirely.

            3.  Update the creation-time of the newly created cookie to
            match the creation-time of the old-cookie.

            4.  Remove the old-cookie from the cookie store.
